=== install dependencies

Script
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickhardiman/ansible-playbook-lab/main/machine-hypervisor.sh[machine-hypervisor.sh]
sets up everything on a freshly installed host.
This works with RHEL and Fedora.
Some things, like that "dnf install" line, won't work on other OSs.

* Log into the hypervisor machine.
* Download the script.

[source,shell]
....
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickhardiman/script-rhel-setup/main/rhel-setup.sh
....

* Read the script and follow the instructions.


The script creates a new user named _ansible_user_
along with a key pair named _ansible-key.priv_ and _ansible-key.pub_
and sudoers privilege escalation.
The playbook uses _ansible_user_ to connect to all the machines,

The script also clones the playbook repo and installs dependencies.
